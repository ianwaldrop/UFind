# What is this this?
I built UFind because I don't like having to reach for the mouse every time I want to find or select something while working. It's boring and slow, and because lazy. This thing tries to solve that.

# Um, why?
Well. My Mac has search. Sublime and Atom both have search. MonoDevelop has search. Unity has search. Wait, what? Yeah, but it's not unified, and it pretty much needs you to click something first. Drat!

Menu items, component, game objects, andÂ all the pretty things in that special snowflake project of yours?

# Extensible
UFind provides a solution for everything. Well, almost everything anyway. It's got some built-in stuff for finding Game Objects, Components, and things in the Asset Database. More will be added over time, and you can also make your own. I know right, more work. But at least it's pretty easy.

# Maintainance
Rome wasn't built in a day, and was eventually sacked.

# Forking
It's got an MIT License so, yeah. Go ahead. Make my day! If you do something seriously awesome with it then [let me know](https://github.com/ianwaldrop/UFind/pulls)!

# Bugs
This thing comes with a [money back guarantee](https://github.com/ianwaldrop/UFind/issues) for that sort of thing.

# Why "UFind"
Because it's better when someone else does the finding.

# Profit
I'm giving this away for free because I like free stuff. I hope you'll check it out, and that you'll like it. Maybe you'll even like it enough to consider a [donation](https://www.paypal.me/IanWaldrop/5)? Maybe.

# Thanks
Yes, thanks!
