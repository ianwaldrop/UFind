#UFind
I built UFind because I don't like having to reach for the mouse every time I want to find or select something while working. It's boring and slow, and because lazy.

#Um, why?
Well. my Mac has search. Sublime and Atom both have search. MonoDevelop has search. Unity has search. But it's not unified, and it pretty much requires that you click something first. And then what about menu items or even custom things in your own projects? Drat! What about pretty, smart, global, search for like anything? What about extensibility? What really happened to the dinosaurs?

#Extensible
UFind provides a solution for all of this. Well, not the dinosaurs. It comes with some built-in stuff for finding Game Objects, Components, and things in the Asset Database. It's also very easy to create your own plugins to filter things on a per-project basis.

#Maintainance
Rome wasn't built in a day, and was eventually sacked.

#Forking
It's got an MIT License so, yeah. Go ahead. Make my day! If you do something seriously awesome with it I'd really like to know about it. Like, heck, maybe make a pull request?

#Profit
I'm giving this away for free because I like free stuff. I hope you'll check it out, and that you'll like it. Maybe you'll even like it enough to consider a [donation](https://www.paypal.me/IanWaldrop/5)? Maybe.

#Thanks
Yes, thanks!
